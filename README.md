The Bonanza game principles revolve around card management, trading, and strategic planning. Players must plant, harvest, and sell beans from their hands and fields, with the goal of earning the most coins. The game challenges players to make decisions on which beans to plant, when to harvest, and how to best utilize their limited field spaces. Trading with the opponent is crucial for optimizing hand and field management. The dynamics of supply and demand in the bean market, along with the timing of trades and harvests, are central to mastering the game.
